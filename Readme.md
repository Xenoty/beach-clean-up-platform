# SereneMarine Local Version

    This is just to keep our project and to run it locally. It will remain private it as it 
    contains MapBoxApi Key and MongoDb Username & Password.

It will contain our original data and functionality.

## How to run Project
1. Just click "Start" and will run both projects.

## Issues:
1. Project does not run both files
    * Make sure that for your project selection (next to the Start button), that it is "Multiple Startup Projects".
    * If there is no Multiple "StartUp Projects", you will need to add it manually.
2. Set solution to start with multiple projects
    * Right-click the Solution and select "Properties"
    * Under Common Properties -> Startup Project, select "Multiple startup projects:"
    * Set both projectts to Action -> Start.
    * Make sure WebApi starts before the website.
