# SereneMarine Local Version

    This is just to keep our project and to run it locally. It will remain private it as it contains MapBoxApi Key and MongoDb Username & Passowrd.

It will contain our original data and functionality.

## How to run Project
1. Just click "Start" and will run both projects.

## Issues:
1. Project does not run both files
    * Make sure that for your project selection (next to the Start button), that it is "Multiple Startup Projects".
2. Website not working
    * Right-click on the project WebApi
    * Go to section Debug in the categories on the left
    * Look at the App Url at the bottom and copy it
    * Go to the appsettings.json in SereneMarine_Web
    * Paste the URL in "URL"
